This repository contains the [HUADA HC32F460 Series DDL](https://www.hdsc.com.cn/Category83-1487), adapted to work with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and [the hc32f46x platform](https://github.com/shadow578/platform-hc32f46x).

> [!TIP]  
> if you're searching for arduino support for HC32F460, take a look at [shadow578/framework-arduino-hc32f46x](https://github.com/shadow578/framework-arduino-hc32f46x/).

> [!NOTE]
> while the primary use-case of this framework is for use with [Marlin](https://github.com/shadow578/Marlin-H32), other use-cases should work too.


## Getting Started

to get started using the HC32F460 DDL, use the following in your `platformio.ini`:

current *development* version:
```ini
[env:my_env]
platform = https://github.com/shadow578/platform-hc32f46x.git
framework = ddl
board = generic_hc32f460
```

latest release versions:
```ini
[env:my_env]
platform = https://github.com/shadow578/platform-hc32f46x/archive/1.0.0.zip
platform_packages =
  framework-hc32f46x-ddl @ https://github.com/shadow578/framework-hc32f46x-ddl/archive/2.2.1.zip

framework = ddl
board = generic_hc32f460
```

> [!TIP]
> when pinning the version, check you're using the latest release(s) to benefit from the latest improvements.
